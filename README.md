# HappinessIndexAnalysis

Abstract - Happiness is considered to be the proper measure of social progress and the goal
of public policy making. It is one of the most important factors to be taken into
consideration while discussing sustainable living and general well-being, both for an
individual and the nation. This report seeks to determine a relation between econometric
variables such as GDP, population etc and happiness index of the countries. The aim is to
find attributes which influence the happiness of people in a country. Additionally, it also
draws logical inferences to assist in the formulation of governmental policies. 

The project was made for our Econometrics course in our fifth semester.
